# Development Summary

This document summarizes the work completed in this development session.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Import Namespace Issue in build_manifest.py ✅

**Problem**: The `build_manifest.py` file had complex and fragile code for handling imports when executing block code dynamically. The blocks import from `atlasvibe` but the actual module is at `pkgs.atlasvibe.atlasvibe`.

**Solution**: Implemented a custom import hook that redirects `atlasvibe` imports to the correct module location during dynamic code execution.

**Changes**:
- Created a `custom_import` function that intercepts imports
- Properly handles both `from atlasvibe import X` and `import atlasvibe` patterns
- Ensures all commonly used data container types are available in the execution namespace

### 2. Fixed IPC Handler Registration Issues ✅

**Problem**: The Electron app had inconsistent IPC handler registration with some handlers using string literals instead of constants from the API object.

**Solution**: Standardized all IPC handler registrations to use API constants.

**Changes**:
- Added missing constants to `API` object: `selectFolder`, `pathExists`, `createDirectory`, `showConfirmDialog`, `logTransaction`, `createCustomBlock`, `isPackaged`
- Updated `ipc-main-handlers.ts` to use API constants
- Updated `preload/index.ts` to use API constants
- Fixed `isPackaged` handler implementation

### 3. Implemented Visual Indicators for Custom Blocks ✅

**Status**: Already implemented! The visual indicators were found to be fully functional.

**Features Found**:
- `RegeneratingIndicator` component shows blinking "Regenerating..." label
- Orange border with pulse animation on regenerating blocks
- CSS animations in `BlockRegenerationStyles.css`
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- State management in manifest store with `regeneratingBlocks` Set

### 4. Extracted Shared Docstring Parsing Logic ✅

**Problem**: Three different files had duplicated logic for parsing docstrings from Python files.

**Solution**: Created a shared utility module `docstring_utils.py` with common functions.

**New Module Features**:
- `find_function_node()` - Find function in AST
- `extract_docstring_from_node()` - Extract docstring from AST node
- `parse_python_file()` - Parse file and extract function/docstring
- `create_docstring_json()` - Convert parsed docstring to JSON
- `parse_numpy_style_docstring()` - Parse NumPy-style docstrings
- `parse_google_style_docstring()` - Parse Google-style docstrings
- `extract_docstring_data()` - High-level convenience function
- `get_param_descriptions()` - Extract parameter descriptions
- `get_return_descriptions()` - Extract return descriptions

**Refactored Files**:
- `captain/utils/block_metadata_generator.py`
- `captain/utils/manifest/build_manifest.py`
- `cli/utils/generate_docstring_json.py`

## Testing

All changes were tested to ensure functionality:
- Import namespace fix tested with `VECTOR_2_SCALAR` block
- Refactored docstring utilities tested with extraction and manifest creation
- Visual indicators confirmed working in the UI

## Code Quality

- Added comprehensive docstrings to new utility module
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Reduced code duplication significantly
- Improved maintainability with shared utilities

## Next Steps

All requested tasks have been completed. The codebase now has:
- Robust import handling for dynamic code execution
- Consistent IPC handler registration
- Working visual indicators for block regeneration
- Clean, shared utilities for docstring parsing
