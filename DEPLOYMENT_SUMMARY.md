# AtlasVibe Package Deployment Summary

## Overview
AtlasVibe has been successfully converted from an ASAR-packaged Electron app to a pip-installable Python package that includes all necessary Electron and JavaScript dependencies.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Removed ASAR Packaging
- Set `asar: false` in `electron-builder.yaml`
- Updated all resource path references in Electron main process files
- Fixed path resolution to work without ASAR packaging

### 2. Created Python Package Structure
- Created `atlasvibe_cli` module with CLI commands
- Implemented CLI with commands:
  - `atlasvibe run` - Run both server and UI
  - `atlasvibe server` - Run backend server only
  - `atlasvibe ui` - Run Electron UI only
  - `atlasvibe init <path>` - Initialize new project
- Configured `pyproject.toml` with hatchling build backend
- Added proper package manifest (`MANIFEST.in`)

### 3. Fixed Import Conflicts
- Renamed root `atlasvibe` directory to `atlasvibe_cli` to avoid conflicts
- Updated all imports to use `pkgs.atlasvibe.atlasvibe` instead of bare `atlasvibe`
- Fixed relative imports within the package

### 4. Installed Missing Dependencies
Successfully installed all missing Python dependencies:
- docstring-parser, portalocker
- nidaqmx, nimodinst
- opencv-python, bcrypt
- pytest-json-report, robotframework
- huggingface-hub, transformers
- scikit-learn, mecademicpy
- And many others...

### 5. Package Building and Installation
```bash
# Build the package
python -m build

# Install the package
pip install dist/atlasvibe-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

The package builds successfully into a 16MB wheel file containing all necessary components.

## Current Status
- ✅ ASAR packaging completely removed
- ✅ Python pip package structure created
- ✅ All dependencies resolved
- ✅ Server runs successfully on port 5392
- ✅ Package can be built and installed via pip

## Running the Deployed Package
From source directory:
```bash
# Run server directly
uv run python3 main.py

# Or use the CLI (after installation)
atlasvibe server
```

The server starts successfully and is accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5392

## Notes
- The package includes all Python modules, blocks, and necessary data files
- Import path resolution works correctly when running from source
- The CLI commands are available after pip installation
- Some adjustments may be needed for running the packaged version in different environments
