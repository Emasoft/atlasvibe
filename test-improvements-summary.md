# Test Improvements Summary

## Removed Mocking

### 1. Created New Test File Without Mocks
- **File**: `tests/captain/test_blocks_api_no_mocks.py`
- **Status**: ✅ All 7 tests passing
- Uses real file operations and actual API endpoints
- Tests the complete integration without mocked dependencies
- Properly tests error handling and rollback scenarios

### Benefits of Removing Mocks
- Tests actual behavior, not mocked responses
- Catches real integration issues
- More reliable and maintainable tests
- Better coverage of edge cases

## Added Comprehensive Playwright Tests

### 1. Custom Block References Test
- **File**: `playwright-test/17_custom_block_references.spec.ts`
- Tests custom block persistence across save/load
- Verifies project format v2.0.0 with custom block metadata
- Tests multiple projects with same block names
- Tests v1 to v2 project migration
- Tests custom block renaming and deletion handling

### 2. Visual Indicators Test  
- **File**: `playwright-test/18_custom_block_visual_indicators.spec.ts`
- Tests distinct visual styling for custom blocks
- Tests hover tooltips with custom block information
- Tests different context menus for custom vs blueprint blocks
- Tests custom block badges/icons
- Tests error state visualization
- Tests visual grouping in sidebar

## Key Features Tested

### API Integration (Without Mocks)
- ✅ Update custom block code
- ✅ Validate project paths
- ✅ Handle missing files
- ✅ Syntax error recovery
- ✅ Manifest regeneration
- ✅ Dependency management

### UI/UX Features
- ✅ Custom block creation dialog
- ✅ Visual differentiation from blueprints
- ✅ Context menu options
- ✅ Code editor integration
- ✅ Project save/load with references
- ✅ Error state handling
- ✅ Sidebar organization

## Running the Tests

### Python Tests (No Mocks)
```bash
uv run pytest tests/captain/test_blocks_api_no_mocks.py -v
```

### Playwright E2E Tests
```bash
# Build the app first
pnpm run build

# Run custom block tests
npx playwright test 17_custom_block_references.spec.ts
npx playwright test 18_custom_block_visual_indicators.spec.ts

# Or run all Playwright tests
npx playwright test
```

## Next Steps

1. **Remove remaining mocked tests** - Replace other heavily mocked test files with integration tests
2. **Add performance tests** - Test with many custom blocks
3. **Add accessibility tests** - Ensure custom block UI is accessible
4. **Add migration tests** - Test various project format migrations
5. **Add conflict resolution tests** - Test handling of naming conflicts
